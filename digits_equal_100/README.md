# The Puzzle

You have the digits 1-9 ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9). You can put a `+` or a `-` between any two digits. Write a program that shows all the solutions which equal 100. You may use any operator any number of times but may not move digits around.

Example of a single solution that adds up to 100:

```
 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9
```
